### What did you personally contribute to the most?
  My major main contributions were:
  1. Exploratory data analysis and data cleanuphttps://github.com/laxmiadh08/msba-portfolio-laxmi/blob/main/individual/contribution.md
  2. Running all three models
  3. Created a tabular view to comapare these model to selec the optimum model
  4. Documentation (powerpoint, final report)

### What is one decision or approach you personally advocated for and why?

  Referrals was one of the decision I personally advocated for because as per my analysis I found that data was from Q3 and as SHAP model
  also suggest it was strong Loyalty Anchor and I thought for a short term goal referral program could bring new customers. Of course 
  ulitmately company need to investigate the bigger problem, it could be either the quality of service or other nuances that customers
  are not liking, but as the holiday seaon was coming referral could be a good action to take and get company new customers.

  
### What are one or two lessons learned from the case competition, and what would you add on or improve in your case if you had more time?
  1. I would definately work more on EDA to find more insights for example I wanted to go deeper since this data was one quarter and there
     were lot of churn 0-3 months meaning these were recently aquired customers, I wanted to know if there was something else causing
     the churn.
  2. I did find there was imbalance but due to some technical issues I chose skip SMOTE or catBoost models, due to technical issues but 
     when checked the score for holdout data was not as good as it should have been, I realized the importance of running these models.
  3. Block time for Powerpoint design and speaking rehearsals
