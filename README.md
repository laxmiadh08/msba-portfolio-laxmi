## Predicting factors causing customer churn using Machine Learning Models

### Problem Statement
TruSource’s growth is currently being undermined by high customer churn, which is destabilizing the company's subscription-based revenue model. While the business relies on predictable, recurring income to fund infrastructure and staffing, the loss of customers creates a "leaky bucket" effect—forcing the company to overspend on acquisition just to maintain the status quo.

Key Pain Points
Financial Erosion: The loss of immediate revenue is compounded by the forfeiture of long-term Lifetime Value (LTV) and referral potential.

Operational Risk: Unpredictable churn rates make financial forecasting unreliable, leading to hesitant or inefficient capital investment.

Strategic Blind Spots: Without identifying the "who" and "why" behind departures, TruSource remains in a reactive cycle rather than a proactive growth phase.

Objective:
To transition from descriptive reporting to predictive modeling, identifying at-risk segments and implementing targeted intervention strategies to secure long-term operational stability.

### Key Insights/Results
Risk Factors:
Internet Plan(Fiber Optics): Identified as the top driver for churn across all models.
Monthly Fee: Higher fees directly increase the probability of a customer leaving.
Payment Method Electronic Check: This specific payment method is a significant indicator of high churn risk.

Loyalty Anchors:
Referral Count: High referral numbers are the strongest indicator of a customer who intends to stay.
Longer Contract Term: Long-term legal commitments are a primary factor in preventing churn.

### Hto Run the Code
1. Clone the repository
2. Install packages listed in the requirement.txt
3. Run python Churnprediction.py

### Limitation
The models rely on historical patterns and may not immediately capture sudden shifts in consumer behavior or market trends.
